@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use the ADC1 and DAC to output on DAC_OUT1 sampled
values of ADC1.
The ADC1 is configured to convert continuously ADC1 channel18 (PB12) for STM32L152-EVAL 
or ADC1 channel31 (PF10) for STM32L152D-EVAL . The End Of Conversion (EOC) interrupt 
is enabled and the conversion is triggered by software.

The DAC channel 1 is configured with output buffer enabled.

Each time the end of conversion interrupt occurs, converted value by ADC1 is written
in DAC channel 1 register.
Thus applied voltage on ADC1 channel18/31 (PB12/PF10) is outputted on DAC_OUT1 (PA4).

@par Hardware and Software environment
  
  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power High-, Medium-Density and Medium-Density Plus Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power High-Density) and STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx Ultra Low 
    Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any 
    other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a variable power supply 0-3.3V to ADC1 Channel18 mapped on pin PB.12
      (potentiometer RV3 can be used).
    @note Make sure that the Jumper JP17 is in PB12 position in case of using RV3.  
    - Connect PA4 (DAC_OUT1) pin to an oscilloscope.

  - STM32L152D-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a variable power supply 0-3.3V to ADC1 Channel31 mapped on pin PF.10
      (potentiometer RV3 can be used).
    @note Make sure that the Jumper JP13 is in ADC position in case of using RV3.  
    - Connect PA4 (DAC_OUT1) pin to an oscilloscope.
