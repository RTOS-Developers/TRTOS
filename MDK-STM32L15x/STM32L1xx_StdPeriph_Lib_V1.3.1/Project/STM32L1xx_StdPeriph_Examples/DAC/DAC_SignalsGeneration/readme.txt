@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the DAC peripheral to 
generate several signals using DMA controller.
When the user presses the KEY push-button, DMA transfers the two selected 
waveforms to DAC.
For each press on KEY button, 2 signals has been selected and monitored on the 
two dac channels:
    - Escalator waveform (Channel 1) and Sine waveForm (Channel 2).
    - Noise waveform (Channel 1) and Triangle waveform (Channel 2).

@note The "system_stm32l1xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      system and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32L1xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.1.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN3309 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>
         
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power High-, Medium-Density and Medium-Density Plus Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power High-Density) and STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx Ultra Low 
    Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any 
    other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up
     - Use KEY push-button connected to PA0.
     - Connect PA4 (DAC Channel1) and PA5 (DAC Channel2) pins to an 
       oscilloscope.
     - Make sure that JP14 is open.

  - STM32L152D-EVAL Set-up
     - Use KEY push-button connected to PA0.
     - Connect PA4 (DAC Channel1) and PA5 (DAC Channel2) pins to an 
       oscilloscope.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - If the used device is STM32L1XX_MD choose "STM32L1XX_MD(STM32L1xxxBxx)" workspace
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32L152_EVAL\stm32l152_eval.c
 - If the used device is STM32L1XX_HD choose "STM32L1XX_HD(STM32L1xxxDxx)" workspace
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32L152D_EVAL\stm32l152d_eval.c 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
