@par Example Description 

  This example provides a short description of how to use the RTC peripheral’s with 
  Alarm sub seconds feature to simulate a timer with refresh time equal to 250 ms
  (1 second/ 8) * 2).
  The RTC is configured to generate sub seconds interrupt each 125ms (will have
  8 interrupt per 1 second).
  
  For this example an interactive human interface is developed using
  STM32L152D_EVAL’s LCD and Push Buttons to allow user to use Timer with a real "sand timer"
  display.

  After startup, the sand timer is equal to 1 Minute (60 Seconds) and by pressing on
  the RIGHT button the bottom bulb start to be filled for each 2 successive
  interrupts (after each 250ms).
  After 480 interrupts (60 * 8) the bottom bulb will be full.

  User can manipulate the chronometer features using the Joystick LEFT, RIGHT, UP and DOWN buttons:
    - press Joystick RIGHT button to Start the timer.
    - press again Joystick RIGHT button to stop the timer.
    - press Joystick LEFT button to Restart the timer.
    - press Joystick  UP/DWON button to adjust the timer.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power High-Density and Medium-Density Plus Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power High-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored 
    to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L152D-EVAL Set-up
    - Use Joystick LEFT button. 
    - Use Joystick RIGHT button.
    - Use Joystick UP button. 
    - Use Joystick DOWN button.

       
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Add the following files to the project source list
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32L152D_EVAL\stm32l152d_eval.c
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32L152D_EVAL\stm32l152d_eval_lcd.c
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
