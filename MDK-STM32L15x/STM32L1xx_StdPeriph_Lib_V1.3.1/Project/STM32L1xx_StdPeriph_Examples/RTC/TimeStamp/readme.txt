@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the RTC peripheral and 
the Time Stamp feature.

One from the following clock can be used as RTC clock source (uncomment the
corresponding define in main.c):
  - LSE oscillator clock usually delivered by a 32.768 kHz quartz.
  - LSI oscillator clock

The program behaves as follows:

1. After startup the user is asked to set the time and date (entered on HyperTerminal).

2. When an External Reset occurs the BKP domain is not reset and the RTC configuration
   is not lost.

3. When power on reset occurs, the BKP domain is reset and the RTC configuration is lost.

4. It configures the RTC_AF1 pin TimeStamp to be falling edge and enables the
TimeStamp detection.

5. On applying a low level on the RTC_AF1 pin (PC.13), the calendar is saved in 
the time-stamp registers thanks to the timestamp event detection.

   
The example uses HyperTerminal to configure the RTC clock, display the current 
time and timestamp registers contents:

 - When pressing Joystick SEL button, the current time and date are saved in RTC TSTR
   and TSDR registers.
 - When pressing Joystick UP button, the TimeStamp Calendar is cleared.
 - When pressing KEY push button, the current RTC Calendar (Time and date) and
   RTC TimeStamp Calendar (Time and date) are displayed.

@note  The RTC_Year member in the TimeStamp Date is always 00 (no years in the RTC_TSDR register)

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power High-, Medium-Density and Medium-Density Plus Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power High-Density) and STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx Ultra Low 
    Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any 
    other supported device and development board.


  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up
    - SEL button connected to PE.08 pin
    - Connect PC.13 to SEL buttons using a wire     
    - Use LED1 connected to PD.00 pin.
    - Use the KEY push button connected to PA.00 pin (EXTI Line0).
    - Use the Joystick UP button connected to PG.11 pin (EXTI Line09).
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
      CN2 (USART2) and PC serial port to display data on the HyperTerminal.
    - LCD Glass pins is shared with USART2 via jumpers, so make sure that
         Jumper 7 (JP7) is in position 1<-->2.
         Jumper 8 (JP8) is in position 1<-->2.
     - Make sure that JP4 is in position (vdd) 1<->2.
  
  - STM32L152D-EVAL Set-up
    - SEL button connected to PG.13 pin.
    - Connect PC.13 to PG.13 pin using a wire.
    - Use LED1 led connected to PD.03 pin.
    - Use the KEY push button connected to PA.00 pin (EXTI Line0).
    - Use the Joystick UP button connected to PG.11 pin (EXTI Line11).
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
      CN1 (USART1) and PC serial port to display data on the HyperTerminal.
    - Make sure that jumper JP4 is in position 2-3

    @note Make sure that the LCD glass module is mounted on “IO” position.

    @note Make sure that jumper JP10 is in (vdd) position.     
      
  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - flow control: None

@par How to use it ?
