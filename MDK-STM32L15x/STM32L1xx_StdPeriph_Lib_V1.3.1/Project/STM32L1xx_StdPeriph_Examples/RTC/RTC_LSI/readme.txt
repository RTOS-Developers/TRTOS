@par Example Description 

This example demonstrates and explains how to use the LSI clock source auto
calibration to get a precise RTC clock. 
As an application example, it demonstrates how to configure the TIM10 timer
internally connected to LSI clock output, in order to adjust the RTC prescaler. 

The Low Speed Internal (LSI) clock is used as RTC clock source.
After reset, the RTC prescaler (asynchronous and synchronous) is set with the 
default LSI frequency (37KHz). 
The RTC WakeUp is configured to generate an interrupt each 1s. The WakeUp counter
is clocked by the RTC CK_SPRE signal (1Hz) and its counter is set to 0x0.
LED1 is toggled inside the RTC WakeUp interrupt each 1s.

The inaccuracy of the LSI clock causes the RTC WakeUp Interrupt to be inaccurate.
The RTC CK_SPRE signal can be monitored by LED1 which is toggled into the RTC 
Wakeup interrupt service routine.

The program waits until Key Push button is pressed to begin the auto calibration 
procedure:
 - Configure the TIM10 to remap internally the TIM10 Channel 1 Input Capture to 
   the LSI clock output.
 - Enable the TIM10 Input Capture interrupt: after one cycle of LSI clock, the
   period value is stored in a variable and compared to the HCLK clock to get
   its real value.
 - The RTC prescaler is adjusted with this LSI frequency value so that the RTC
   CK_SPRE value become more accurate.
 - When calibration is done LED2 is turned ON to indicate the end of this operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power High-, Medium-Density and Medium-Density Plus Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power High-Density) and STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx Ultra Low 
    Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any 
    other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up
    - Use LED1 and LED2 leds connected respectively to PD.00 and PD.01 pins
    - Use the Key push button connected to PA.00 pin


  - STM32L152D-EVAL Set-up
    - Use LED1 and LED2 leds connected respectively to PD.03 and PD.07 pins
    - Use the Key push button connected to PA.00 pin
