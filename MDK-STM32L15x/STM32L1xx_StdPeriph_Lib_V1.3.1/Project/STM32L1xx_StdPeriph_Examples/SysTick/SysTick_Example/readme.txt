@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the SysTick to generate a time base equal to
1 ms. The system clock is set to 32 MHz, the SysTick is clocked by the AHB clock
(HCLK).

A "Delay" function is implemented based on the SysTick end-of-count event.
Four LEDs are toggled with a timing defined by the Delay function.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power High-, Medium-Density and Medium-Density Plus Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power High-Density) and STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx Ultra Low 
    Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any 
    other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L152D-EVAL Set-up
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PD.03, PD.07, PG.14
      and PG.15 pins 
    
  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PD.00, PD.01, PD.04
      and PD.05 pins 
    - Make sure that JP18 and JP19 are closed.
      
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - If the used device is STM32L1XX_MD choose "STM32L1XX_MD(STM32L1xxxBxx)" workspace
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32L152_EVAL\stm32l152_eval.c
 - If the used device is STM32L1XX_HD choose "STM32L1XX_HD(STM32L1xxxDxx)" workspace
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32L152D_EVAL\stm32l152d_eval.c 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
