@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to enable and disable the write protection
for the STM32L1xx FLASH memory:

- Enable Write protection: 
   To enable the Write Protection, uncomment the line "#define WRITE_PROTECTION_ENABLE"
   in main.c file.  
   To Enable the write protection of the STM32L1xx Flash, the user has to call 
   FLASH_OB_WRPConfig function.
   The parameter of this function will define the number of pages to be protected 
   and the state of the specified FLASH (ENABLE).
   To load the new option byte values, a system Reset is necessary, for this, the
   function FLASH_OB_Launch() is used.
 
- Disable Write protection:
   To disable the Write Protection, uncomment the line "#define WRITE_PROTECTION_DISABLE"
   in main.c file.
   To Disable the write protection of the STM32L1xx Flash, the user has to call 
   FLASH_OB_WRPConfig function.
   The parameter of this function will define the number of pages to be unprotected 
   and the state of the specified FLASH (DISABLE).
   To load the new option byte values, a system Reset is necessary, for this, the
   function FLASH_OB_Launch() is used.
   
- Program the selected pages:
  To program the desired pages (if the flash is not write protected) uncomment 
  the line  "#define FLASH_PAGE_PROGRAM" in main.c file. 

If the desired pages are not write protected, an erase and a write operation are
performed.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power High-, Medium-Density and Medium-Density Plus Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power High-Density) and STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx Ultra Low 
    Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any 
    other supported device and development board.
      
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - If the used device is STM32L1XX_MD choose "STM32L1XX_MD(STM32L1xxxBxx)" workspace
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32L152_EVAL\stm32l152_eval.c
 - If the used device is STM32L1XX_HD choose "STM32L1XX_HD(STM32L1xxxDxx)" workspace
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32L152D_EVAL\stm32l152d_eval.c 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
