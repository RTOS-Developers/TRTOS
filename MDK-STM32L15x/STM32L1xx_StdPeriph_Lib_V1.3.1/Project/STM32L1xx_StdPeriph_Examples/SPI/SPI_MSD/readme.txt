@par Example Description 

This example provides a basic example of how to use the SPI firmware library
and an associate SPI SDcard driver to communicate with an SDcard available on The eval board.
The first step consist in filling the SPI Tx buffer. Then this last one is written 
on the micro sd cards. A comparison between the Buffer transmitted (Tx_Buffer )and 
the received one (Rx_Buffer) is done and LED1 is turned on in caseof success otherwise 
LED2 is turned on.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power High-, Medium-Density and Medium-Density Plus Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored 
    to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up
    - Use LED1 and LED2 connected respectively to PD.00 and PD.01 pins
    - MicroSD card is already available on this board.
    - Make sure that the Jumper 2 is plugged
      
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32L152_EVAL\stm32l152d_eval.c
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32L152_EVAL\stm32l152_eval_spi_sd.c
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
