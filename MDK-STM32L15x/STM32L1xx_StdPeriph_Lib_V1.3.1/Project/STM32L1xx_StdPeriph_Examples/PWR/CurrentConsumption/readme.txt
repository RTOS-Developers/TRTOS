@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the STM32L1xx system to measure different
Ultra Low Power modes current consumption. The Ultra Low Power modes are:
  - Low Power Run Mode from Internal SRAM
  - Low Power Run Mode from Internal FLASH
  - Sleep Mode
  - Low Power Sleep Mode
  - STOP mode with or without RTC
  - STANDBY mode with or without RTC

To run this example, user has to follow the following steps:
 1. Select the Ultra Low power modes to be measured by uncommenting the corresponding
    line inside the stm32l1xx_ulp_modes.h file.
       #define LP_RUN_SRAM_MODE
       #define LP_RUN_FLASH_MODE
       #define SLEEP_MODE
       #define LP_SLEEP_MODE
       #define STOP_MODE
       #define STOP_RTC_LSE_MODE
       #define STOP_RTC_LSI_MODE
       #define STANDBY_MODE
       #define STANDBY_RTC_LSE_MODE
       #define STANDBY_RTC_LSI_MODE  
  
 2. Use an external amperemeter to measure the IDD current. 
 
 3. This example can not be used in DEBUG mode as the JTAG IOs are disabled to
    reduce power consumption.
    
Here below a detailed description of the example code:

  @verbatim
 1. First, the  code checks if the BOR is disabled or not. If the BOR is ON, the 
    code writes to Option Bytes and launch and Option byte loading phase generating
    a system reset.

 2. After reset, the program waits for Key button connected to the PA.00 to be 
    pressed to enter the selected ultra low power mode.
     - When the RTC is not used in the ultra low power mode configuration, press
       again the Key button to exit the low power mode.
     - When the RTC is used, the wakeup from low power mode is automatically 
       generated by the RTC (after 4s).

 3. Ultra Low power modes description:

      ARM Compiler
      ------------
      RAM functions are defined using the toolchain options. 
      Functions that are be executed in RAM should reside in a seperate
      source module. Using the 'Options for File' dialog you can simply change
      the 'Code / Const' area of a module to a memory space in physical RAM.
      Available memory areas are declared in the 'Target' tab of the 
      'Options for Target' dialog.

      ICCARM Compiler
      ---------------
      RAM functions are defined using a specific toolchain keyword "__ramfunc".  
        
      GNU Compiler
       ------------
      RAM functions are defined using a specific toolchain attribute
      "__attribute__((section(".data")))".
