@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the programmable BOR thresholds using the 
FLASH option bytes.

- Configure the BOR threshold: 
To modify the BOR threshold, uncomment the line "#define BOR_MODIFY" and select
the voltage range using the the line "#define BOR_LEVEL" in main.c file. 

To load the new option byte values, a system Reset is necessary, for this, the
function FLASH_OB_Launch() is used.

A LED connected to a specific GPIO pin is toggling to indicate that the reset
is released and the system is in RUN mode otherwise the BOR is mainting the 
reset.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power High-, Medium-Density and Medium-Density Plus Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power High-Density) and STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx Ultra Low 
    Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any 
    other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up
    - Use Jumper 13 in position 1<->2 and adjust the VDD.
    - Use LED1 led connected to PD.00 pin

  - STM32L152D-EVAL Set-up
    - Use Jumper 5 in position 1<->2 and adjust the VDD.
    - Use LED1 led connected to PD.03 pin

      
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - If the used device is STM32L1XX_MD choose "STM32L1XX_MD(STM32L1xxxBxx)" workspace
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32L152_EVAL\stm32l152_eval.c
 - If the used device is STM32L1XX_HD choose "STM32L1XX_HD(STM32L1xxxDxx)" workspace
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32L152D_EVAL\stm32l152d_eval.c 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
