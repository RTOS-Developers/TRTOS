@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use the I2C to communicate with 
an STLM75 (or a compatible device) I2C temperature sensor is mounted on the 
STM32L152-EVAL and STM32L152D-EVAL boards and used to get instantaneous external
 temperature (-55°C to +125°C).
Thanks to STM32 I2C SMBus feature, we can easily monitor the temperature 
variations. This is managed by the SMBus Alert which is generating a dedicated 
interrupt informing the system that the temperature is out of the selected 
ranges.
The user can configure the TOS and THYS thanks to a dedicated define values in 
the code.

By default the STM32L152-EVAL and STM32L152D-EVAL demo are setting them to (see main.c file):
  
   #define TEMPERATURE_THYS 31
   #define TEMPERATURE_TOS 32

@par Hardware and Software environment
  
  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power High-, Medium-Density and Medium-Density Plus Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power High-Density) and STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx Ultra Low 
    Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any 
    other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up
     - Make sure that the Jumper JP11 is fitted.
  
  - STM32L152D-EVAL Set-up
     - Make sure that the Jumper JP14 is fitted.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - If the used device is STM32L1XX_MD choose "STM32L1XX_MD(STM32L1xxxBxx)" workspace
    - Add the following files to the project source list
