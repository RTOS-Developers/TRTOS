@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to configure the AES hardware 
accelerator to encrypt then to decrypt text.
This example is a basic example using polling on flag, neither interrupt nor 
DMA capability are used.

  - AES/EncryptDecrypt/stm32l1xx_it.c      Interrupt handlers
  - AES/EncryptDecrypt/stm32l1xx_it.h      Interrupt handlers header file

@note The "system_stm32l1xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      system and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32L1xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.1.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN3309 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>
         
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L162 Ultra Low Power High-Density and Medium-Density Plus Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power High-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored 
    to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L152D-EVAL Set-up
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PD.03, PD.07, PG.14
      and PG.15 pins 
    
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Add the following file to the project source list
    - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32L152D_EVAL\stm32l152d_eval.c 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
