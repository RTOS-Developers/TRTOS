@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use the TIM peripheral to measure the frequency of an 
external signal, The meausred Frequency is desplayed on the LCD Glass.

The TIMxCLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock (Hz), the Prescaler is 0 so the 
TIM4 counter clock is SystemCoreClock (Hz).

SystemCoreClock is set to 32 MHz for Ultra Low Power Medium-Density and High-Density 
Devices.

TIM4 is configured in Input Capture Mode: the external signal is connected to 
TIM4 Channel2 used as input pin.
To measure the frequency we use the TIM4 CC2 interrupt request,
so in the TIM4_IRQHandler routine, the frequency of the external signal is computed.
The "TIM4Freq" variable contains the external signal frequency:
TIM4Freq = TIM4 counter clock / Capture in Hz,
where the Capture is the difference between two consecutive TIM4 captures.

For Ultra Low Power Medium-Density and High-Density Devices,the minimum frequency 
value to measure is 488 Hz.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power High-, Medium-Density and Medium-Density Plus Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power High-Density) and STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx Ultra Low 
    Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any 
    other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect the external signal to measure to the TIM4 CH2 pin (PB.07).
    - LCD Glass pins is shared with USART3 via jumpers, so make sure that
      Jumper 7 (JP7) is in position 1<-->2.
      Jumper 8 (JP8) is in position 1<-->2.

  - STM32L152D-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect the external signal to measure to the TIM4 CH2 pin (PB.07).
	  - LCD Glass pins is shared with some IO, so make sure that the LCD Glass is 
      in LCD position
