@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM9 peripheral to generate two different 
signals with two different frequencies.

The TIM9CLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock / 2 (Hz), and we want to get TIM9
counter clock at 4 MHz so the Prescaler is computed as following:
   - Prescaler = (TIM9CLK / TIM9 counter clock) - 1
SystemCoreClock is set to 32 MHz for Ultra Low Power Medium-Density Devices.

The TIM9 CCR1 register value is equal to 10928: 
CC1 update rate = TIM9 counter clock / CCR1_Val = 366.03 Hz,
so the TIM9 Channel 1 generates a periodic signal with a frequency equal to 183.1 Hz.

The TIM9 CCR2 register is equal to 5464:
CC2 update rate = TIM9 counter clock / CCR2_Val = 732.06 Hz
so the TIM9 channel 2 generates a periodic signal with a frequency equal to 366.3 Hz.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power High-, Medium-Density and Medium-Density Plus Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power High-Density) and STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx Ultra Low 
    Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any 
    other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L152-EVAL and STM32L152D-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different 
      waveforms:
        - TIM9 CH1 (PA.02) 
        - TIM9 CH2 (PA.03) 
  
@par How to use it ?
