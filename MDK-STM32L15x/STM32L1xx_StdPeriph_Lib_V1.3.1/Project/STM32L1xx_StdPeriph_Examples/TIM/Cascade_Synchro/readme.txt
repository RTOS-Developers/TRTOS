@par Example Description 

This example shows how to synchronize TIM peripherals in cascade mode.
In this example three timers are used:

Timers synchronisation in cascade mode:

1/TIM2 is configured as Master Timer:
     - PWM Mode is used
     - The TIM2 Update event is used as Trigger Output  

     2/TIM3 is slave for TIM2 and Master for TIM4,
     - PWM Mode is used
     - The ITR1(TIM2) is used as input trigger 
     - Gated mode is used, so start and stop of slave counter
      are controlled by the Master trigger output signal(TIM2 update event).
      - The TIM3 Update event is used as Trigger Output. 

      3/TIM4 is slave for TIM3,
     - PWM Mode is used
     - The ITR2(TIM3) is used as input trigger
     - Gated mode is used, so start and stop of slave counter
      are controlled by the Master trigger output signal(TIM3 update event).

       The TIMxCLK is fixed to 32 MHz, the TIM2 counter clock is 32 MHz.

       The Master Timer TIM2 is running at TIM2 frequency :
       TIM2 frequency = (TIM2 counter clock)/ (TIM2 period + 1) = 500 KHz 
       and the duty cycle = TIM2_CCR1/(TIM2_ARR + 1) = 25%.

       The TIM3 is running:
       - At (TIM2 frequency)/ (TIM3 period + 1) = 125 KHz and a duty cycle
         equal to TIM3_CCR1/(TIM3_ARR + 1) = 25%

        The TIM4 is running:
      - At (TIM3 frequency)/ (TIM4 period + 1) = 31.25 KHz and a duty cycle
        equal to TIM4_CCR1/(TIM4_ARR + 1) = 25%

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power High-, Medium-Density and Medium-Density Plus Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power High-Density) and STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx Ultra Low 
    Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any 
    other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different 
      waveforms:
        - TIM2 CH1 (PA.05) 
        - TIM3 CH1 (PA.06)
        - TIM4 CH1 (PD.12)
    - Make sure that JP14 is open.

  - STM32L152D-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different 
      waveforms:
        - TIM2 CH1 (PA.05) 
        - TIM3 CH1 (PA.06)
        - TIM4 CH1 (PD.12)
        
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
