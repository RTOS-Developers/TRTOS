@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use a DMA channel to transfer
continuously a data from a peripheral (ADC1) to another peripheral (TIM2) supporting
DMA transfer.The ADC channel18 ( when using the STM32L152-EVAL) or ADC channel31 
(when using the STM32L152D-EVAL) is configured to be converted continuously. 
TIM2_CH1 is configured to generate a PWM signal on its output.
The dedicated DMA1 channel2 is configured to transfer in circular mode the last ADC 
channel18/31 converted value to the TIM2_CCR1 register. The DMA channel request is driven
by the TIM2 update event. The duty cycle of TIM2_CH1 output signal is then changed
each time the input voltage value on ADC channel18/31 pin is modified.
The duty cycle variation can be visualized on oscilloscope on the TIM2_CH1 pin
PA.00 while changing the analog input on ADC channel18/31 using the potentiometer.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power High-, Medium-Density and Medium-Density Plus Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power High-Density) and STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx Ultra Low 
    Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any 
    other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a variable power supply 0-3.3V to ADC Channel18 mapped on pin 
      PB.12 (potentiometer RV3)
    - Connect an oscilloscope to TIM2_CH1 (PA.00) pin.


  - STM32L152D-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a variable power supply 0-3.3V to ADC Channel31 mapped on pin 
      PF.10 (potentiometer RV3)
    - Connect an oscilloscope to TIM2_CH1 (PA.00) pin.
