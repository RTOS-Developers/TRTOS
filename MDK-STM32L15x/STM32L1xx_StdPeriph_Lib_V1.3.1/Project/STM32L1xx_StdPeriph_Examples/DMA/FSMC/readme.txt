@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use two DMA channels to transfer
a word data buffer from Flash memory to external SRAM memory and to recuperate
the written data from external SRAM to be stored in internal SRAM.

DMA2 Channel5 is configured to transfer, word by word, the contents of a 32-word data 
buffer stored in Flash memory to the external SRAM memory interfaced by FSMC.
The start of transfer is triggered by software. DMA2 Channel5 memory-to-memory
transfer is enabled.
Source and destination address incrementing is also enabled. The transfer is started
by setting the Channel enable bit for DMA2 Channel5. A polling on the Transfer Complete
flag is done to check the end of transfer. The DMA2 Channel5 Transfer complete flag
is then cleared.

DMA1 Channel3 is configured to transfer, byte by byte, the contents of the first
128Bytes of external SRAM to the internal SRAM memory. The start of transfer is
triggered by software. DMA1 Channel3 memory-to-memory transfer is enabled.
Source and destination address incrementing is also enabled. The transfer is started
by setting the Channel enable bit for DMA1 Channel3. A polling on the Transfer Complete
flag is done to check the end of transfer.

A comparison between the source and destination buffers is done to check that all data
have been correctly transferred.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power High-density devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power High-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored 
    to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32L152D_EVAL\stm32l152d_eval.c
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32L152D_EVAL\stm32l152d_eval_fsmc_sram.c
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
