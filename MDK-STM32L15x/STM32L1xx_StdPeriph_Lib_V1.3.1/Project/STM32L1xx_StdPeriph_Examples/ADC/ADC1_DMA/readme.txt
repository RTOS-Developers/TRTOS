@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use the ADC1 and DMA to transfer continuously 
converted data from ADC1 to memory.
The ADC1 is configured to convert continuously ADC channel18 when using the
STM32L152-EVAL or ADC channel31 when using the STM32L152D-EVAL.

Each time an end of conversion occurs the DMA transfers, in circular mode, the
converted data from ADC1 DR register to the ADC_ConvertedValue variable.
The ADC1 clock is set to HSI (16 MHz).

@par Hardware and Software environment
  
  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power High-, Medium-Density and Medium-Density Plus Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power High-Density) and STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx Ultra Low 
    Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any 
    other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L152D-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a variable power supply 0-3.3V to ADC Channel31 mapped on pin PF.10
      (potentiometer RV3).
    - Make sure that the Jumper JP13 is in ADC position.
    
  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a variable power supply 0-3.3V to ADC Channel18 mapped on pin PB.12
      (potentiometer RV3).
    - Make sure that the Jumper JP17 is in PB12 position.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
