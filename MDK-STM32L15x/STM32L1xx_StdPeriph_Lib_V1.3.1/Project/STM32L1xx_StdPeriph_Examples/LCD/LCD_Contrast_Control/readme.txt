@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use the STM32L1xx embedded LCD GLASS  
controller and how to Configures the LCD Contrast. 
The ADC1 is configured to converts continuously ADC channel18 when using the
STM32L152-EVAL or ADC channel31 when using the STM32L152D-EVAL. Each time 
an end of conversion occurs, the LCD GLASS contrast is updated.
The messages displayed on the Pacific Display LCD glass (PD-878) mounted on 
STM32L1xx-EVAL board is proportional to each LCD Contrast level.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power High-, Medium-Density and Medium-Density Plus Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power High-Density) and STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx Ultra Low 
    Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any 
    other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a variable power supply 0-3.3V to ADC Channel18 mapped on pin PB.12
      (potentiometer RV3).
    @note Make sure that the Jumper JP17 is in PB12 position.
    - LCD Glass pins is shared with USART3 via jumpers, so make sure that
        Jumper 7 (JP7) is in position 1<-->2.
        Jumper 8 (JP8) is in position 1<-->2.

  - STM32L152D-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a variable power supply 0-3.3V to ADC Channel31 mapped on pin PF.10
      (potentiometer RV3).
    @note Make sure that the embedded LCD GLASS is in LCD position.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - If the used device is STM32L1XX_MD choose "STM32L1XX_MD(STM32L1xxxBxx)" workspace
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32L152_EVAL\stm32l152_eval.c     
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32L152_EVAL\stm32l152_eval_glass_lcd.c
 - If the used device is STM32L1XX_HD choose "STM32L1XX_HD(STM32L1xxxDxx)" workspace
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32L152D_EVAL\stm32l152d_eval.c   
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32L152D_EVAL\stm32l152d_eval_glass_lcd.c
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
