@par Example Description 

This example demonstrates how to declare a dynamic peripherals pointers used for
Debug mode.  

To use Debug mode you have to add the stm32l1xx_ip_dbg.c file to your application.
This creates a pointer to the peripheral structure in SRAM. Debugging consequently
becomes easier and all register settings can be obtained by dumping a peripheral 
variable.

When the "USE_FULL_ASSERT" label is uncommented (in stm32l1xx_conf.h file),
the assert_param macro is expanded and run-time checking is enabled in the firmware
library code. The run-time checking allows checking that all the library functions
input value lies within the parameter allowed values.

The associated program simulates wrong parameter passed to library function and the
source of the error is printed on Hyperterminal (through USART).

@note
The Debug mode increases the code size and reduces the code performance. For this
reason, it is recommended to used it only when debugging the application and to
remove it from the final application code.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power High-, Medium-Density and Medium-Density Plus Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power High-Density) and STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx Ultra Low 
    Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any 
    other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
      CN2 and PC serial port.
    - Make sure that JP9 should is in position 1<-->2

  - STM32L152D-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the USART1 connector
      CN1 and PC serial port.
    - Make sure that JP3 should is in position 1<-->2
 
  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - flow control: None
           
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - If the used device is STM32L1XX_MD choose "STM32L1XX_MD(STM32L1xxxBxx)" workspace
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32L152_EVAL\stm32l152_eval.c
 - If the used device is STM32L1XX_HD choose "STM32L1XX_HD(STM32L1xxxDxx)" workspace
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32L152D_EVAL\stm32l152d_eval.c
 - Add the required example file
    - stm32l1xx_ip_dbg.c
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

@note Known Limitations
      This example retargets the C library printf() function to the Hyperterminal
      (C library I/O redirected).
      TrueSTUDIO Lite version does not support I/O redirection, and instead
      have do-nothing stubs compiled into the C runtime library. 
      To use printf() with TrueSTUDIO Professional version, just include the
      TrueSTUDIO Minimal System calls file "syscalls.c" provided within the toolchain.
      It contains additional code to support printf() redirection.
