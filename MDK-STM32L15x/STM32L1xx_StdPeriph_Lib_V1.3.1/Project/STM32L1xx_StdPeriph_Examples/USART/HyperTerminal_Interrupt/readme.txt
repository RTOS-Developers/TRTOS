@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use the EVAL_COM2 when using the
STM32L152-EVAL (or EVAL_COM1 when using the STM32L152D-EVAL) Transmit and Receive 
interrupts to communicate with the hyperterminal.


First, the EVAL_COM2 when using the STM32L152-EVAL (or EVAL_COM1 when using the STM32L152D-EVAL)
sends the TxBuffer to the hyperterminal and still waiting for a string from the hyperterminal
that you must enter.The string that you have entered is stored in the RxBuffer array. The receive
buffer have a RxBufferSize bytes as maximum (the reception is stopped when this
maximum receive value is reached).

The EVAL_COM2 (or EVAL_COM1) is configured as follow:
    - BaudRate = 9600 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits (7 data bit + 1 parity bit)
    - Two Stop Bit
    - Odd parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled

@note When the parity is enabled, the computed parity is inserted at the MSB
position of the transmitted data.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power High-, Medium-Density and Medium-Density Plus Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power High-Density) and STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx Ultra Low 
    Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any 
    other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
      CN5(when USART3 is used) and PC serial port.
    - Make sure that JP7 and JP8 are in position 2<->3 
     
  
  - STM32L152D-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
         CN1(when USART1 (EVAL_COM1) is used) and PC serial port.

  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - Word Length = 7 Bits
    - Two Stop Bit
    - Odd parity
    - BaudRate = 9600 baud
    - flow control: None 


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - If the used device is STM32L1XX_MD choose "STM32L1XX_MD(STM32L1xxxBxx)" workspace
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32L152_EVAL\stm32l152_eval.c
 - If the used device is STM32L1XX_HD choose "STM32L1XX_HD(STM32L1xxxDxx)" workspace
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32L152D_EVAL\stm32l152d_eval.c 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
