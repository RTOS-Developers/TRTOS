@par Example Description 

This example provides a basic example of how to use the FSMC firmware library and
an associate driver to perform erase/read/write operations on the M29W128GL NOR 
memory mounted on the STM32L152D-EVAL board.

@par Directory contents 

  - FSMC/NOR/stm32l1xx_conf.h    Library Configuration file
  - FSMC/NOR/stm32l1xx_it.c      Interrupt handlers
  - FSMC/NOR/stm32l1xx_it.h      Header for stm32l1xx_it.c

  - FSMC/NOR/system_stm32l1xx.c  STM32L1xx system source file  

@note The "system_stm32l1xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      system and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32L1xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.1.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN3309 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>


@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power High-Density Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power High-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored 
    to any other supported device and development board.
    
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Add the following files to the project source list
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32L152D_EVAL\stm32l152d_eval.c
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32L152D_EVAL\stm32l152d_eval_fsmc_nor.c  
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
