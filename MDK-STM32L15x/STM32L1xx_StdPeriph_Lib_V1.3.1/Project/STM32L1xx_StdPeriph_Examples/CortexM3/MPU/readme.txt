@par Example Description 

This example presents the MPU features on STM32L1xx devices and it can be easily
ported to any other STM32 device supporting MPU.

The example purpose is to configure a memory region as privileged read only region
and tries to perform read and write operation in different mode.

If the access is permitted LED1 is toggling. If the access is not permitted, 
a memory management fault is generated and LED2 is ON.
To generate an MPU memory fault exception due to an access right error, uncomment
the following line "PrivilegedReadOnlyArray[0] = 'e';" in the "stm32_mpu.c" file.

@par Hardware and Software environment
  
  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power High-, Medium-Density and Medium-Density Plus Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power High-Density) and STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx Ultra Low 
    Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any 
    other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain and setup your project configuration as follows
 - If the used device is STM32L1XX_MD choose "STM32L1XX_MD(STM32L1xxxBxx)" workspace
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32L152_EVAL\stm32l152_eval.c
 - If the used device is STM32L1XX_HD choose "STM32L1XX_HD(STM32L1xxxDxx)" workspace
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32L152D_EVAL\stm32l152d_eval.c
 - Add the required example file
   - stm32_mpu.c
<ul>
- For TrueSTUDIO toolchain you have to follow these instructions   
 
    - In the project properties window, select C/C++ Build->settings node 
      then the C Linker->General node and use "stm32l1xx_flash_ROAarray.ld" 
      as Script File.
      This linker is configured for STM32L1xx. It should be updated to use 
      it with other STM32 devices.         
</ul>    
 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
