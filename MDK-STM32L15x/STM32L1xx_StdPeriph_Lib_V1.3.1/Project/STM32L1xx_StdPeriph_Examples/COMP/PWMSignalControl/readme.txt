@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure COMP2 peripheral to hold on safe state
(low level) TIM2 channels as soon as COMP2 output is set at high level.

  - COMP2 is configured as following:
     - Inverting input is internally connected to VREFINT = 1.22V
     - Non Inverting input is connected to PB5
     - Output is internally connected to TIM2 OCREFCLR (output compare reference clear)

  - TIM2CLK is set to 32 MHz, the TIM2 Prescaler is equal to 0 so the TIM2 counter
    clock used is 32 MHz.
    TIM2 frequency is defined as follow:
    TIM2 channels frequency = TIM2 counter clock / (Period + 1) 
                            = 32000000 /(65535 + 1) 
                            = 488 Hz.

  - External voltage should be connected to PB5 (RV3 potentiometer can be used).

  - Connect an oscilloscope to TIM2 channels (PA0 and PA1) to display waveforms. 

  - While PB5 is lower than VREFINT (1.22V), PWM signal is displayed on PA0 and PA1.
    While PB5 is higher than VREFINT, PA0 and PA1 are in low level.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power High-, Medium-Density and Medium-Density Plus Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power High-Density) and STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx Ultra Low 
    Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any 
    other supported device and development board.


  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up
    - Make sure that JP17 is set in PB5 position (to connect Potentiometer RV3
      to COMP2 non inverting input)
    - Remove jumper JP11
    
  - STM32L152D-EVAL Set-up
    - Make sure that JP13 is set in PB5 position (to connect Potentiometer RV3
      to COMP2 non inverting input)
    - Remove jumper JP14    

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
 - Connect TIM2 channels to an oscilloscope
 - Rotate RV3 potentiometer and note PA0 and PA1 states changing: 
    if RV3 < VREFINT, PA0 and PA1 at PWM
    if RV3 > VREFINT, PA0 and PA1 at low level
