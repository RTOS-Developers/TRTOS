@par Example Description 

  In some applications, it is recommended to power-on ADC1 only if it is required 
  since it can jeopardize battery life time if left powered-on continuously. 
  In this example, COMP2 is used to monitor the analog voltage while the MCU 
  is in stop mode and to wake-up the system if a predefined threshold is crossed.
  When the analog voltage crosses the threshold, the COMP2 is powered-off and
  ADC1 is powered-on to perform continuous conversion.

  MCU is switching between two modes: 
    - If analog voltage is above the internal reference voltage (VREFINT), 
      ADC1 is powered-on and continuous conversion is performed of channel 18 (PB12)
      for STM32L152_EVAL and performed of channel 31 (PF10) for STM32L152D_EVAL :
      MCU is in run mode, LD1 is OFF and measured voltage is displayed on 
      LCD Glass and color LCD for STM32L152_EVAL and on only color LCD for 
      STM32L152D_EVAL.
    - If analog voltage is under VREFINT, ADC1 is powered-off and COMP2 is 
      powered-on, the MCU enters stop mode and LD1 is ON.

  COMP2 is configured as following:
    - Inverting input is VREFINT: this is the selected threshold
    - Non Inverting input is connected to PB5
    - Edge detection config is rising edge

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power High-, Medium-Density and Medium-Density Plus Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power High-Density) and STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx Ultra Low 
    Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any 
    other supported device and development board.


  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a variable power supply 0-3.3V to both: ADC Channel18 mapped on pin PB.12
      (potentiometer RV3) and COMP2 inverting input mapped on pin PB5.
    @note Using Jumper JP17, connect one jumper in PB12 and another in PB5 
          position. Thus PB5 and PB12 are both connected to RV3.
    - Remove jumper JP11
    - Make sure that JP10 is in TRST position

  - STM32L152D-EVAL Set-up
   - Connect a variable power supply 0-3.3V to both: ADC Channel31 mapped on pin PF.10
     (potentiometer RV3) and COMP2 inverting input mapped on pin PB5.
    @note Using Jumper JP13, connect one jumper in ADC and another in COM_IN+ 
          position. Thus PB5 and PF10 are both connected to RV3.
    - Remove jumper JP14
